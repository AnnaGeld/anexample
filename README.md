# Install

1. Decide where you want the project to live and clone your fork to that directory
2. Setup a vhost to host the project and point the doc root to the /public directory
3. Open a terminal session either through vscode or another utility so that you can run composer install
   in the same directory as the composer.json file
4. Once composer has installed the dependencies run composer dumpautoload just to be sure
5. Load the host in your web browser and you should get data being dumped to the browser. Just white page and black text.
